## 📖 The Story

> *"Born of the Festival. Forged in Silence. Awakened by Truth."*

**The Sparrows** follows four elite operatives—descendants of the Soviet "Children of the Festival" generation. Each carries the legacy of cross-continental solidarity movements from the 1950s-1980s, now weaponized for a fractured modern world.

### The Team

| Operative | Heritage | Specialty | Background |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Natasha Gannibal** | Russia × Ethiopia | Hacker | Descendant of Abram Gannibal's line, mathematical prodigy |
| **Maria Kofi** | Ghana × Ukraine | Combat | Capoeira-Systema fusion fighter, counter-insurgency expert |
| **Anya Delgado** | Cuba × Russia × Angola | Sniper | Cold War legacy, precision under pressure |
| **Olga Hassanova** | Uzbek × Sudanese | Strategy | Cipher specialist, spiritual and tactical core |
